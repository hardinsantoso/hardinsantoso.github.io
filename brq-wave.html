            <div class="section-11"><div class="container"><div class="rtf w-richtext"><h4>Introduction</h4><p>This project is worked together in cooperation with a manager at Wavesuara, a new podcast company that aggregrates and create content.</p><p>The project undertakes what could be improved from the current business process or activities at wavesuara, and in relation to the said manager function, which is content. We decided to improve the content management system and the delivery, from one needing third-party platform such as Spotify or Facebook, to in-house platform more dedicated to suit Wavesuara's needs. This project look for what is needed for such, the requirement, the justification and the risk of doing so.</p><br><br></div></div></div>
            
            <div class="section-14"><div class="container"><div id="w-node-9f3b600b5440-9f567103" class="rtf w-richtext"><h4>The Background</h4><p>Wavesuara is a company that runs media streaming such as podcast, audio streaming and radio. Wavesuara currently manages multiple platform that run by third party and uses social media as way of streaming. The social media platform is not dedicated to radio streaming thus the delivery is not optimal.<br>Wavesuara is a company established at November 2019 by Waves founders Kevin and Ben who previously worked at McKinsey, Google, and they also have several businesses in Silicon Valley. Starting from Vietnam and now present in Indonesia - continues to grow to provide the best content in Southeast Asia. They are now steadily growing their base in Indonesia and look for way to expand it better.</p><p>It would have been better to have the most effective implementation of online platform that is developed in-house for maximum control and potential. A platform that uses the current internet infrastructure would provide Wavesuara with a way to expand their base better. Indonesia is home of 123 Million internet user, a big user base potential for Wavesuara.</p>
                <h4>Business Context</h4><p>The business case of Wavesuara is they aggerate content or create it via their numerous podcaster and base of connected network to reach for interviewees. The content is then be delivered to target audience or listener. The process is done via a third-party platform and the outreach is done in traditional way. The development of technology has enabled small company to grow faster though online media, just like Wavesuara. However, it would have been better to have a most and effective implementation of online platform in businesses when they employ a more personal first-party platform and supplement the traditional way of delivering content.<br></p><h5>Needs and Opportunities</h5><p>It is acknowledged that Wavesuara needs to have a platform gain more information on audience as it is a new company needing to gain shares in the market, using third-party platform such as facebook, youtube or directfm resulted in lack of information gathering on the customer and the information gained is not owned by Wavesuara, this results in loss of opportunity to gain insight on audience. Therefore the application need to be selfoperated and independent or in-house, offer a good content management and delivery, and able to handle customer data as metrics well to assist marketing and content creation purposes as well as reaching the end-user better.</div></div></div>
            
            <div class="section-13"><div class="container"><div class="rtf w-richtext"><h4>Process Improvement</h4><p>The current process makes use of third party partners and result in less independence and also less leeway of how the company can gain more data from the user, it is identified that an improvement of metric of information can net benefit the company in term of knowing the user even better. Wavesuara through third-party non radio dedicated base platform that require user to log on to third party provider and the data is owned by the third party rather than fully by Wavesuara. The metrics produced are manually screened and analysed by the employee. </p><figure style="max-width:2600pxpx" id="w-node-54f521b8bbbc-9f567103" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="waveold.png" alt=""></div><figcaption>The old process</figcaption></figure><p>Taking in the new platform, the benefit would be the metric increases. Previously the metrics that wavesuara can gain on their viewership and amount of people tuning in is limited to three metrics (listener count, geography, device). With independent platform, Wavesuara can increase the metrics by adding viewing time, tag preference, and engagement ratio, 6 metrics. Communicating with external third-party to accommodate the business alongside with maintaining and building a traditional deliverance system cost the company working hours and thus the amount needs to be shelled out for that. The reduction will be 66% as the result improvement from average of three-day preparation for media push to just a day needed for media push.<br><figure style="max-width:2600pxpx" id="w-node-54f521b8bbbc-9f567103" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="wavenew.png" alt=""></div><figcaption>The review gathered on excel view</figcaption></figure></p>
                
                <h5>Project Risk and Needs analysis</h5><p>The project then undertakes of what is needed, and what are the risk, however I could not list them here as it might be not prudent to write it all even though I am not tied to any NDA, as it relates to their base operation, budgetary, and other company spesific aspects. In here I conducted series of survey, focus group discussion, and general discussion with the PIC which is the content manager, and the user of Wavesuara to get to know what is best fit, and to realize the identified business process improvement above.</p></div></div></div>

Digitizing the platform would have objective to be able to gather more data and analyze it by system. With the dependencies, benefits and risk analysis alongside with possible business provess improvement is done, I think the project is sound to be conducted and implemented. This project teaches me on how to communicate with various stakeholders, work together with project owner, hear their user needs and their target market needs, and all in all a quite enrinching endevour for me.<br></p></div></div></div>
